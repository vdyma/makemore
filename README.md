# Character-level n-gram models

Implementation of character-level n-gram models. Simple model uses character counts and an advanced model is a single-neuron neural network.

The implementation is intentionally left naive and over-simplified for demonstration and education purposes.

## Installation

Clone this repository and create environment using conda:

```commandline
conda env create -n ngram --file environment.yaml
```

## Implementation and usage

Refer to [n_gram.py](n_gram.py) for implementation details and [n_gram.ipynb](n_gram.ipynb) for usage example.
